# Emma Lundquist
### ***1. What are the modifications you made to the game?***
I did parts 4-6 on the tutorial. I made the camrea follow John, created the post-processing effects, and started on the Gargoyle Prefab.
<br><br>

### ***2. What's the biggest challenge you have so far?***
Post-processing. I couldn't get the effects to display in the game correctly. I had to read a couple of Reddit forums and the discord to figure out what was happening. I ended up using a different way than the John Lemon tutorial, and just bypassed the Post-processing volume node.  
<br><br>

### ***3. Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?***
I kinda want to make him look like John Lennon cause I think it would be funny. Otherwise probably not.

### ***1. What are the modifications you made to the game?***
I did tutorial parts 7-9. Building off of Emma's modifications, I added the Ghost enemy and implemented waypoints and movement using the NavMesh and WaypointControl.cs script. I made minor modifications to other scripts when I added audio and I also added our studio's logo and a lemon icon to the game. 
<br><br>

### ***2. What's the biggest challenge you have so far?***
I initially messed up when creating the PointOfView prefab and I ended up deleting it which was a mistake. I had to recreate it, but thankfully this didn't take long because the script was still there. I also went a bit ahead of the tutorial and ended up making the parent object of the enemies off-center. When I tried fixing it Unity would shift all of their positions, so I just decided to leave it. 
<br><br>

### ***3. Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?***
I plan to recreate the project on my own time! I mostly want to follow the tutorial from start to finish, but I might do as many suggested modifications from our final assignment as I can for extra practice.

<!-- SUMMER'S SECTION -->
# Summer Smith
### ***1. What are the modifications you made to the game?***
I did parts 1-3 of the tutorial. I imported all of the assets, placed John Lemon and the level into the scene, made the first script for the player to control John, made the animations work on John, and baked the Navmesh.
<br><br>

### ***2. What's the biggest challenge you have so far?***
The biggest challenge for me was troubleshooting the gravity for John. I ended up having to make the project's gravity positive so he wouldn't fly upwards off the screen.
<br><br>

### ***3. Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?***
I would like to do the rest of the tutorial in order to better understand how all of the components worked in the entire project!

<!-- ASHER'S SECTION -->
# Asher Moffitt
### ***1. What are the modifications you made to the game?***
I started by adding a simple sprint mechanic to the game that allows the player to move at 2x speed when the shift key is pressed. This added a bit of skill to the game and overall made the game more fun. I also added a shield powerup to the game that allows the player to destroy a ghost instead of being caught.
<br><br>

### ***2. What's the biggest challenge you have so far?***
The biggest challenge I faced was with adding the shield. I had some problems getting the shield to work at first but I was able to get some help from my team to fix it.
<br><br>

### ***3. Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?***
I have a lot of game dev projects in the works already that require my attention but I learned some important stuff through completing this project so im happy about the work I contributed.
