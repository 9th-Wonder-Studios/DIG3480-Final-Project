### ***1. What are the modifications you made to the game?***
I did tutorial parts 7-9. Building off of Emma's modifications, I added the Ghost enemy and implemented waypoints and movement using the NavMesh and WaypointControl.cs script. I made minor modifications to other scripts when I added audio and I also added our studio's logo and a lemon icon to the game.

### ***2. What's the biggest challenge you have so far?***
I initially messed up when creating the PointOfView prefab and I ended up deleting it which was a mistake. I had to recreate it, but thankfully this didn't take long because the script was still there. I also went a bit ahead of the tutorial and ended up making the parent object of the enemies off-center. When I tried fixing it Unity would shift all of their positions, so I just decided to leave it.

### ***3. Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?***
I plan to recreate the project on my own time! I mostly want to follow the tutorial from start to finish, but I might do as many suggested modifications from our final assignment as I can for extra practice.
