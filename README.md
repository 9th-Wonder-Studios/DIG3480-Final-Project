# Emma Lundquist
### ***1. What are the modifications you made to the game?***
I did parts 4-6 on the tutorial. I made the camrea follow John, created the post-processing effects, and started on the Gargoyle Prefab.
<br><br>

### ***2. What's the biggest challenge you have so far?***
Post-processing. I couldn't get the effects to display in the game correctly. I had to read a couple of Reddit forums and the discord to figure out what was happening. I ended up using a different way than the John Lemon tutorial, and just bypassed the Post-processing volume node.  
<br><br>

### ***3. Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?***
I kinda want to make him look like John Lennon cause I think it would be funny. Otherwise probably not.

### ***1. What are the modifications you made to the game?***
I did tutorial parts 7-9. Building off of Emma's modifications, I added the Ghost enemy and implemented waypoints and movement using the NavMesh and WaypointControl.cs script. I made minor modifications to other scripts when I added audio and I also added our studio's logo and a lemon icon to the game. 
<br><br>

### ***2. What's the biggest challenge you have so far?***
I initially messed up when creating the PointOfView prefab and I ended up deleting it which was a mistake. I had to recreate it, but thankfully this didn't take long because the script was still there. I also went a bit ahead of the tutorial and ended up making the parent object of the enemies off-center. When I tried fixing it Unity would shift all of their positions, so I just decided to leave it. 
<br><br>

### ***3. Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?***
I plan to recreate the project on my own time! I mostly want to follow the tutorial from start to finish, but I might do as many suggested modifications from our final assignment as I can for extra practice.

# Summer Smith
### ***1. What are the modifications you made to the game?***
I did parts 1-3 of the tutorial. I imported all of the assets, placed John Lemon and the level into the scene, made the first script for the player to control John, made the animations work on John, and baked the Navmesh.
<br><br>

### ***2. What's the biggest challenge you have so far?***
The biggest challenge for me was troubleshooting the gravity for John. I ended up having to make the project's gravity positive so he wouldn't fly upwards off the screen.
<br><br>

### ***3. Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?***
I would like to do the rest of the tutorial in order to better understand how all of the components worked in the entire project!
